  <h>My Experience in Hawaii</h>
<p>
I had a great time in Hawaii. My aunt and uncle were living there for a time. I got to visit for about 6 weeks. I'm very lucky for having this experience and being able to spend so much time there
</p>
<p>
 Many times I would here in movies about how 'magical' it felt to be there, but I never believed them. Although it was a little different from what I expected, the experience was as close to magical as I could imagine.
 <br>
 The temperature there is almost perfect, typically ranging from 80-90 in the summer. The constant breeze makes it feel much more bearable. There's tons of wildlife roaming around constantly and very unique plants I've never seen before. The ocean water is very clean, and multiple times we saw sea turtles and jellyfish while we were in the water. There's so many things to love about Hawaii: the culture, the wildlife, the climate, etc. It was sad to finally leave, but I am grateful to have an experience other people may not be able to have.
